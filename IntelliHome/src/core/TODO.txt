TODO:

Rewrite manual func to generate IDs for transactions and transmissions separately

allow for longer length transmissions
*Create a permission to send system if NRFs dont communicate reliably.
    ^NRFs must send a permission to transmit request to server before transmitting. If server does not acknowledge and allow, it waits to send and maybe asks again until server allows it
    ^no longer necessary. Reliable communication attained

create an expected response object when we are expecting a response from a module before performing some action(like waiting for an init OK ex. "BEGIN,1", from a module
  Places to implement:
    -Module Ack before init
    -Module init
  ^Unnecessary

Tranmission object needs a RETRY ID which can be appended. EX 'A' , 'B' , 'C' , etc...
  ^ WHY? --Delayed until necessary
